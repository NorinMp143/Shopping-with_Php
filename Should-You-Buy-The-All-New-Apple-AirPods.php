								<p>Be it an iPhone or any other Apple device, they become the talk of town months before their launch. That’s Apple, a brand that has always been one step ahead and the leader in new technology. In fact, apart from the iPhone 7, if there’s anything that iPhone lovers have still been discussing, it’s the company’s own, first-ever wireless headphones, launched in 2016 – Apple AirPods.</p>
								<p>When Apple first announced the AirPods, there was a lot of criticism from people on social media because Apple also announced about doing away with the headphone jack for iPhone 7. It was also mocked on social for its ugly design and unbelievable pricing. In case you thought Airpods only pair with Apple devices, let us tell you that they also pair with Android smartphones, tablets, Windows PC and Apple TV. Here’s everything you ever wanted to know about Apple AirPods…</p>

								<p><b>How do they charge?</b><br>
AirPods come with a magnetic case that does the job of carrying and charging them. The case is charged via a lightning port, the same as on the iPhone or iPad. The AirPods connect to your iPhone via Bluetooth using a combination of software in iOS and a processor called W1chip. The W1 chip inside each AirPod is what makes it perform better than a normal wireless headphone. As far as the AirPods battery life is concerned, in a single charge it has up to 5 hours of listening time or up to 3 hours with just a 15-minute charge in the case.

								<p><b>Sound-wise It Does Stand Out</b><br>
Though AirPods work like any other Bluetooth pairing devices, it does stand out for its sound quality. It’s got a good audio quality and comes with dual beam-forming microphones that filter out background noise, according to Apple.

								<p><b>AirPod Features</b><br>

The AirPods can actually detect when the earphones are being taken out of your ears. This is possible because of the built-in optical sensors and motion accelerometers. It also pauses your music, the moment you take them out of your ears. Not just this, if you get a call while you’re listening to music and you’d like to take the call without your earphones, you can do that! Once you hang up and put the earphones back into your ears, it will resume music playback automatically. Another cool thing about the AirPods is that double tapping on it connects you to Siri for any assistance. However, this is possible only if you have an active internet connection.

								<p><b>What’s Not Good?</b><br>
One thing that’s disappointing about the AirPods is that it has no physical controls and that means depending on Siri for everything. If you want to turn up or lower the volume while listening to music, you’re expected to double tap one of the AirPods. The music will then pause and you can tell Siri you want to turn up or turn down the volume.

								<p><b>You Can Also Share Your AirPods</b><br>
Yes, that’s possible, unlike the wired earphones. You can put one in your ear and the other in someone else’s and enjoy your music but you can’t share a pair for phone calls. And guess what? In case, you happen to lose one, you need not worry! With just one earbud, you can still make calls or listen to music.

								<p>We’d conclude by saying, AirPods are pretty cool and the right investment for people who’re fitness freaks, travellers and music lovers. They’re light weight, water-resistant and wireless. When we say water-resistant, we mean you can use them during monsoon but do not dive in the swimming pool with your AirPods. Of course, there are plenty of other options available in the market but if you’re brand conscious and a die-hard Apple fan, this one’s for you.</p>
